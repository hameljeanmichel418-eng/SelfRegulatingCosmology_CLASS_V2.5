Computing non-linear matter power spectrum with Halofit (including update Takahashi et al. 2012 and Bird 2014)
 -> [WARNING:] Non-linear corrections could not be computed at redshift z= 3.34 and higher.
    This is because k_max is too small for the algorithm (Halofit or HMcode) to be able to compute the scale k_NL at this redshift.
    If non-linear corrections at such high redshift really matter for you,
    just try to increase the precision parameter nonlinear_min_k_max (currently at 5.000000e+00) until k_NL can be computed at the desired z.
