P(k) physical window (k <= 1 h/Mpc):
  z = 0.0: max ΔP/P = 9.03e-04 at k = 6.405385e-02 h/Mpc (tolerance: 2e-02) ✓
  z = 0.5: max ΔP/P = 2.62e-05 at k = 8.427810e-02 h/Mpc (tolerance: 2e-02) ✓
  z = 1.0: max ΔP/P = 4.36e-06 at k = 3.303397e-01 h/Mpc (tolerance: 2e-02) ✓
  z = 2.0: max ΔP/P = 4.37e-06 at k = 3.303397e-01 h/Mpc (tolerance: 2e-02) ✓

C_ℓ^TT physical window (ℓ <= 2000):
  max ΔC_ℓ/C_ℓ = 1.23e-03 at ℓ = 1550.0 (tolerance: 2e-02) ✓
======================================================================
RESULT: ✓ PASS - SRC perturbation spectra consistent with ΛCDM at O(1–2%) in the physical window
        - P(k) differences are smooth and within 2% tolerance for k ≤ 1 h/Mpc at all redshifts
        - C_ℓ differences are smooth and within 2% tolerance for ℓ ≤ 2000
